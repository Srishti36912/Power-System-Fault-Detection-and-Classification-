# Power-System-Fault-Detection-and-Classification

### Problem Statement
Power distribution systems are prone to various faults due to environmental, equipment, or operational failures. These faults can lead to blackouts, equipment damage, or system instability. Current methods for fault detection are often slow, manual, or rule-based, lacking the intelligence for real-time classification. There is a critical need for automated and accurate fault detection and classification to ensure grid reliability, safety, and quick restoration.
